# Test seed for atomicity detection
# Contains mix of atomic and non-atomic ACs

goal: "Create a simple greeting utility"

constraints:
  - "Python 3.10+"
  - "No external dependencies"
  - "Single file implementation"

acceptance_criteria:
  # This should be NON-ATOMIC (multiple distinct actions with "and")
  - "Create a greeter module AND add unit tests AND update documentation"

  # This should be NON-ATOMIC (vague scope)
  - "Improve the overall code quality and performance"

  # This should be ATOMIC (single, specific outcome)
  - "Add a greet() function that takes a name and returns 'Hello, {name}!'"

  # This should be NON-ATOMIC (multiple file changes implied)
  - "Implement CLI interface with argument parsing and add integration tests"

  # This should be ATOMIC (localized, clear scope)
  - "Add type hints to the greet function"
