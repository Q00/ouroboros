# Ouroboros Documentation

> The serpent that devours itself to be reborn anew.

Ouroboros is a self-improving AI workflow system that transforms ambiguous human requirements into clear, executable specifications through Socratic questioning and ontological analysis.

## Key Concepts

### The Six Phases

1. **Big Bang (Phase 0)** - Socratic and ontological questioning to crystallize requirements into a Seed (Ambiguity <= 0.2)
2. **PAL Router (Phase 1)** - Progressive Adaptive LLM selection (Frugal -> Standard -> Frontier)
3. **Double Diamond (Phase 2)** - Discover, Define, Design, Deliver with recursive decomposition
4. **Resilience (Phase 3)** - Stagnation detection and lateral thinking via persona rotation
5. **Evaluation (Phase 4)** - Three-stage verification (Mechanical, Semantic, Consensus)
6. **Secondary Loop (Phase 5)** - TODO registry and batch processing

### Economic Model

| Tier | Cost | When |
|:----:|:----:|------|
| FRUGAL | 1x | complexity < 0.4 |
| STANDARD | 10x | complexity < 0.7 |
| FRONTIER | 30x | critical decisions |

### Core Principles

- **Frugal by default, rigorous in verification** - Start with the simplest approach, escalate only when needed
- **Ambiguity threshold** - Requirements must have ambiguity score <= 0.2 before execution begins
- **Lateral thinking** - When stuck, switch persona and think differently rather than retry harder
