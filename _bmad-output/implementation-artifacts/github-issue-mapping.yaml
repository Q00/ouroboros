# Status Sync Instructions:
# ========================
# When updating a story status locally (in sprint-status.yaml):
# 1. Update sprint-status.yaml with new status
# 2. Use gh cli to update the GitHub issue:
#    - ready-for-dev: No GitHub change needed (default state)
#    - in-progress: gh issue edit <number> --add-label "in-progress"
#    - review: gh issue edit <number> --add-label "review"
#    - done: gh issue close <number>
#
# When an Epic is complete (all stories done):
#    gh issue close <epic_number>
